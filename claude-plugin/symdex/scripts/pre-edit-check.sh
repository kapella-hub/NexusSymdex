NexusSymdex reminder: Before applying this edit, consider whether you've checked what other code depends on what you're changing. If you're modifying a function signature, return type, class interface, or public API, call get_callers() and get_impact() on the affected symbol first. If this is a simple internal change (string, comment, local variable), proceed without additional checks.
